    -- WHAT THIS PACKAGE IS FOR, AND WHY IT IS A PACKAGE.
    --
    -- The device counterpart of `apple-simulator-tools`. mcpp's `runner` is an
    -- argv prefix, and `mcpp run --target aarch64-ios --format app` hands the
    -- runner a signed bundle. Running that bundle on hardware is a session --
    -- choose a connected device, install the bundle, launch it by its bundle
    -- identifier, attach its output -- which a manifest cannot express as a
    -- flag, exactly the argument `apple-simulator-tools` makes for simulators.
    -- mcpp:plugins' `dist-apple` supplies this runner under the name `app` on
    -- the device row, so a project names neither the program nor a path.
    --
    -- macOS ONLY. `devicectl` ships inside Xcode (15 and newer), talks to the
    -- CoreDevice service of the machine running it, and has no counterpart to
    -- package: this program only drives it, the category the index's
    -- host-surface rule permits for a proprietary runtime that exists on one
    -- OS -- named here rather than reached by a fallthrough.
    --
    -- WHAT IS AND IS NOT MEASURED. The script parses (`bash -n` at install
    -- time), and its refusals -- no xcrun, no devicectl, no bundle, no
    -- connected device -- are checked on a macOS runner with no device
    -- attached. Installing and launching on hardware needs a device, a
    -- provisioning profile and a signing identity, none of which a hosted CI
    -- runner has, so that path is written from `devicectl`'s own help text and
    -- is not yet measured. In particular, whether `process launch --console`
    -- reports the launched program's exit status is unmeasured; this runner
    -- returns what `devicectl` returns, and says so when it launches, so a
    -- test result read through it is not mistaken for the program's own until
    -- that has been measured -- the discipline `apple-simulator-tools` 0.3.0
    -- applied to `simctl launch`.
    --
    -- DEVICE SELECTION. `DEVICECTL_RUN_DEVICE` names a device by the
    -- identifier, UDID or name `xcrun devicectl list devices` prints; unset,
    -- the first iOS device whose tunnel is connected is used. The same shape
    -- as `SIMCTL_RUN_UDID` in `apple-simulator-tools`.
